// There are three control statements in javaScript
// - Conditional statement
// - Looping statement
// - Jumpint statement

// Why control statements are required?
// when you write javaScript code, all the lines will be executed at the same time, this is by default
// if I want to execute set of statements based upon a cirten condition, if the condition is true I want to
// run the A set of statement, and if not true, then I want to run the B set of statements.
// this is possible using these control statements in javaScript
